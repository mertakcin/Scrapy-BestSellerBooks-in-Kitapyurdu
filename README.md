# Scrapy-BestSellerBooks-in-Kitapyurdu
Taking the info of first 60 best seller books that are sold in "kitapyurdu.com" (Learn-by-doing mini project)

I followed a course of Mustafa Murat Co≈ükun on Udemy to build the project.

You need to install;

  * Scrapy Framework (pip install scrapy) 
  * You would need to install Scrapy Framework to your conda environment. To do that, check out the documentation(https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/install.html)
  

You need to write `scrapy crawl books` to run the code. 
* "books" represents the name of the spider.

+ book_spider.py = This script will create a txt file that contains the info of 60 best seller books in "kitapyurdu.com"

  I tried to explain the steps with comments in book_spider.py file. Happy Coding!
